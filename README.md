# Hello-Erlang!
This repo follows the "Getting Started" tutorial on the official [Erlang Documentation](https://www.erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/users_guide)

Also, here is a nice video for getting to know the Erlang Language: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOqQVoVai6s
The video explains the history of the language, and its applications on functional, distributed and parallel programming.

## 1. The Shell, Modules and Functions
The tutorial begins explaining how the Erlang Shell works, how to compile and run Erlang code, and the use of "." asthe end of commands. To compile an .erl file, execute the command c([module_name]) with the name of the module with the same nam as the file. Speaking of modules, the tutorial follows on how to define modules and export functions. Functions in Erlang are defined similarly to mathematical functions: f(x) -> y. If you use a ";" instead of "." on the end of a command, the compiler interprets that as if the function still has more definitions to come. This can be seen on [tut1.erl](https://github.com/vhpadula/erlang-hello-world/blob/main/tut1.erl).

This shows ease of use of Erlang for Functional Programming.
